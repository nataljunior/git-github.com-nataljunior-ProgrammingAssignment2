## At first, setting the WD that contains the files
## To solve the problem I just set the matrix in the first function as x
## Solved the value S as NULL and put a MEAN in every SOLVE that was mentioned in the last version

setwd('C:/Users/natal/Downloads/rprog_data_specdata/specdata/specdata')
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix(sample(1:100,15),5,5)) {
        s <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                s <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() s
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)
}

## Same as before, changing MEAN to SOLVE and m to s


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        s <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(s)) {
                message("getting inversed matrix")
                return(s)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        s <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(s)
        s
}
